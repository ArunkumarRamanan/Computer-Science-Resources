Thus, **insertion in a Python list is actually O(n)**, while operations that search for an element at a particular spot are O(1) since each location is indexed like in an array.

        "In choosing a hash function, often there is a trade-off between complexity in time and space. One can use hashed value buckets with multiple values in each which and take a longer to find the value or use a sparse hash table so each hashed value corresponds to no more than one value but the table is large and takes up a lot of space. As a measure of where on the scale a particular hash table lies, we define a \"load factor\":\n",

        "    Load Factor = Number of Entries / Number of Buckets.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of a load factor is to give us a sense of how \"full\" a hash table is. For example, if we're trying to store 10 values in a hash table with 1000 buckets, the load factor would be 0.01, and the majority of buckets in the table will be empty. We end up wasting memory by having so many empty buckets, so we may want to rehash, or come up with a new hash function with less buckets. We can use our load factor as an indicator for when to rehash—as the load factor approaches 0, the more empty, or sparse, our hash table is. \n",
        "\n",
        "On the flip side, the closer our load factor is to one (meaning the number of values equals the number of buckets), the better it would be for us to rehash and add more buckets. Any table with a load value greater than 1 is guaranteed to have collisions.\n",

        "    a) 87 is prime so decent 5*87 = 435 so we would still definitely have collisions (5 and 440 would have the same hash value for example).\n",
        "    b) 107 is also prime and 5*107 = 535 so if the numbers are between 5 and 500 we are guaranted no collisions.\n",

We can then balance the tree as described below in Case 5. In the example below the left tree shows the tree after insertion before rotation and the right tree shows the tree after rotation. We insert the node 16 at the bottom of the tree which is red (16R), its parent, 13, is also red (13R) and it's sibling is a black null node B. The inserted node (16R) is a right child and it's parent (13R) is a left child. To correct this we perform a left rotation between the inserted node's parent (13R) and its two children. After this rotaion the original inserted node and it's parent switch relationships. The inserted node is now 13R.\n",

        "### Directional Graphs\n",
        "\n",
        "Edges can have direction in which case two nodes can have two edges between them (this is not the case in an undirected graph).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cycles in Graphs\n",
        "\n",
        "Graphs can be **cyclic** (contain cycles, i.e. there exist paths continaing one or more edges that return to the same vertex) or not, i.e. **acyclic**. With cyclic graohs we need to be more careful in avoiding infinte loops when traversing them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Connectivity\n",
        "\n",
        "    Connectivity = minimum number of edges that need to be removed for a graph to become disconnected \n",

        "We can use this definition of connectivity to measure how strongly connected a graph is. \n",

        "#### Connected:\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Weakly Connected:\n",
        "A directed graph is weakly connected when only replacing all of the directed edges with undirected edges can cause it to be connected. Imagine that your graph has several vertices with one outbound edge, meaning an edge that points from it to some other vertex in the graph. There's no way to reach all of those vertices from any other vertex in the graph, but if those edges were changed to be undirected all vertices would be easily accessible.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The most obvious one (in an object-oriented language) being a class with edge and vertex objects with properties like names/ids nd edges might also have a strength. Vertex objects could have a list of edges it's connected to and vice versa. Traversing a graph with this repreasentation can be inconvenient if one needs to search through edges and vertices. There are some simpler representations that only use lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6.2.2 Edge List:\n",
        "A list of edges! An edge is represented by a list of 2 elements where each element corresponds to a vertex and the two elements represent and edge between the vertices. This is a 2D list.\n",

        "A list with an element corresponding to each vertex in the graph. The i<sup>th</sup> element of this list is a list of all the vertices connected to the i<sup>th</sup> vertex of the graph. This is again a 2D list but the inner lists need not have the same size.\n",

        "### 6.2.4 Adjacency Matrix:\n",
        "A square binary matrix M with as many rows/columns as there are verticies in the graph. The element at the i<sup>th</sup> row and the j<sup>th</sup> column, M<sub>i,j</sub> is a 1 if there is an edge running from the i<sup>th</sup> to the j<sup>th</sup> vertex and zero otherwise.\n",

        "### 6.2.5 Implementation of Graph Representations\n",
        "\n",
        "Graphs crop up often in interviews and in computer science in general, and you could need to represent it in any of it's forms. Here we add functions to a Graph class to return various representations of the same graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "A graph will have two different components: Nodes and Edges. Nodes are pretty much the same as they were in trees. Instead of having a set number of children, each node has a list of Edges. We assume that edges have both a value and a direction. An edge points from one node to another—the node it starts at is the node_from and the node it ends at is the node_to. You can envision it as node_from -> node_to.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Graph class contains a list of nodes and edges. You can sometimes get by with just a list of edges, since edges contain references to the nodes they connect to, or vice versa. However, our Graph class is built with both for the following reasons: \n",
        "\n",
        "- If you're storing a disconnected graph, not every node will be tied to an edge, so you should store a list of nodes.\n",
        "- We could probably leave it there, but storing an edge list will make our lives much easier when we're trying to print out different types of graph representations. \n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, having both makes insertion a bit complicated. We can assume that each value is unique, but we need to be careful about keeping both nodes and edges updated when either is inserted."
